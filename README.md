# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


To run:
Backend:
- npm install
- npm run server

Admin/Frontend
- npm install
- npm run dev

Issues that needs to be solved:
1. Store and backend still has speciality as general physcian etc which needs to be changed.
2. Even api are defined as coders/list which needs to be changed in backend and admin.


Flows that needs to be tested:
1. Login/SignUp flow (tested by Sudhanshu)
2. Book Appointment flow (Pending)
3. Payment Flow (Pending)
